Dear reviewer, this folder contains our demo videos:

1.  **Comparison\_with\_several\_state-of-the-art\_methods methods.mp4**&#x20;

    This video contains the qualitative study comparison of DAWN with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline methods.

2.  **Extrapolation\_evaluation.mp4**

    This video contains the visualization of extrapolation evaluation of DAWN, which corresponds to Table 3 in the paper.

3.  **Ablation\_study\_on PBNet.mp4**&#x20;

    This video contains the the visualization of effectiveness of our PBNet, which corresponds to the Table 4 in the paper.&#x20;

4.  **Cross-identity\_reenactment.mp4**

    This video contains the visualization of pose and blink control of DAWN.

5.  **Different\_styles\_at\_higher\_resolution.mp4**

    This video contains the audio-driven results with out-of-set portraits with multiple styles in higher resolution (256 x 256). The audio is from the test set of the HDTF dataset.

6.  **Driven\_by\_music.mp4**

    This video contains our demo of audio-driven results, with out-of-set portraits with multiple styles. The audio is a song clip selected from "You Belong with Me" (Taylor Swift, 2008), which is considered out-of-distribution data.

Thank you for watching. We plan to release our code in the future.
